# NLP_Amazon_Reviews_Analysis

Nowadays, Natural Language Processing is a hot and trending topic. Analyzing the text is crucial in many industries. In E-commence, for example, analyzing product reviews can help the company to cluster different types of customers, and thus the companies can recommend corresponding products to increase revenue.  Because of the importance of NLP, in this project, I choose a dataset containing Amazon Watch reviews to analyze whether there is any pattern that exists for the customers. I use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures. In the end of the project, I successfuly identified several patterns in the reviews clusters and thus made some suggestions to Amazon regrading recommending products to customers in different product.
