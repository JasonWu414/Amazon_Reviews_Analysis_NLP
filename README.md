# Amazon_Reviews_Analysis_NLP

Nowadays, Natural Language Processing is a hot and trending topic. Analyzing the text is crucial in many industries. In E-commence, for example, analyzing product reviews can help the company to cluster different types of customers, and thus the companies can recommend corresponding products to increase revenue.  Because of the importance of NLP, in this project, I choose a dataset containing Amazon Watch reviews to analyze whether there is any pattern that exists for the customers. I use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

The original dataset is from here: [Dataset information](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html)
